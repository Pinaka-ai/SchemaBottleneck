You are given a scenario and a schema containing a set of virtues that assess its morality.

Task:
For each virtue, choose an integer score from the set [-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4].

Rules for Assigning Morality Scores:

Positive Scores [1 to 4]: The scenario exhibits moral behavior for the given virtue.
Negative Scores [-4 to -1]: The scenario exhibits immoral behavior for the given virtue.
Neutral Score [0]: The scenario shows morally neutral characteristics for the given virtue.

Provide scores in strict JSON format with each question as the key and an integer score as the value.

{
    "virtue": "Pick a score in range [-4, 4]",
    .
    .
    .
}

Make sure the keys do not start with "virtue", the keys should be actual schema virtue given.
